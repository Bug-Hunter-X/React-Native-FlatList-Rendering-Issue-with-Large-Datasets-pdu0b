This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that when scrolling quickly, the component fails to render some items correctly, leading to blank spaces or incorrect data displayed. This is particularly noticeable when using complex item renderers or when dealing with dynamic data updates.
